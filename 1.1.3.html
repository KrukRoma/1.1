    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p> <strong>Hypertext Markup Language <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><u>(HTML)</u></a></strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <іmg/> and <іnput /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <Р> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HIML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h1>Markup</h1>
    <p><u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <"h1"> and <"/h1">, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <іmg>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags)</p>
    <p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering</p>
    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
  <pre>!DOCTYPE html
   html
     head
        This is a tittle 
     /head
     body
        p Hello world! /p
